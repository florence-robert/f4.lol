Welcome to my personal website and portfolio repository. This site showcases my professional journey, projects, and skills. It's built using [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Structure

### Web App

Astro web application with some Alpine and HTMX to explore the technologies.

### Resume (LaTeX)

My resume is crafted in LaTeX for precise formatting. Find the source files in the `resume` directory. The compiled resume can be viewed [here](resume/). It gets compiled automatically by a GHA when any of the tex files are modified.
